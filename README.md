# wp_postlocator

wp_postlocator uses the exif information from pics to feed the GeoMasup plugin (https://code.google.com/p/wordpress-geo-mashup/); it also uses the post geo to do the same (which the plugin also does).

Note: IOS has obscure GEO tagging, the workaround is to use the Wordpress plugin for mobiles.
